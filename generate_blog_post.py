Behind the Plate: TBA
Umpire assignment has not been announced, which makes prop volatility a concern.

6. Betting Breakdown
Final Lean & Betting Takeaway
STEP-BY-STEP BETTING ANALYSIS:

STEP 1: Check ALL individual batters for prop opportunities
None of the batters meet both criteria of xBA > 0.300 and a boost > +20 points, hence no lean on individual batters.

STEP 2: Check team strikeout rates for pitcher props
The Pirates' projected K-rate does not exceed 25%, nor does it increase by more than 4%, so no lean on strikeout props. The Reds' K-rate increase of 2.8% is noteworthy but not enough for a lean.

STEP 3: Report findings
No significant statistical edges meet our betting threshold in this matchup.

CRITICAL EXAMPLES:
Juan Soto (.263 → .369, +106) = LEAN ✅ (meets both criteria)
Randal Grichuk (.235 → .278, +43) = NO LEAN ❌ (.278 < .300)
Player (.285 → .315, +30) = LEAN ✅ (meets both criteria)
Atlanta 23.4% → 27.6% K% (+4.2%) = LEAN OVER ✅ (meets both criteria)

12. ALWAYS include the betting information right after the game time
